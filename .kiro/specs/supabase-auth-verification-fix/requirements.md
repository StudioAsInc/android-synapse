# Supabase Authentication Verification Fix Requirements

## Introduction

Fix the authentication flow where users are created in Supabase but show "Authentication Failed" during login. The issue occurs because Supabase requires email verification by default, but the app doesn't handle the verification flow properly.

## Glossary

- **Supabase Auth**: Supabase's authentication service that handles user registration and login
- **Email Verification**: Process where users must click a link in their email to verify their account
- **Authentication Flow**: The complete process from user registration to successful login
- **Confirmation Status**: Whether a user's email has been verified in Supabase
- **Auth State**: The current authentication status of a user (signed in, signed out, pending verification)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand why my login fails after successful registration, so that I know what action to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with unverified email, THE Authentication_System SHALL display a clear message indicating email verification is required
2. WHEN a user signs up successfully, THE Authentication_System SHALL inform the user to check their email for verification
3. WHEN a user's email is not verified, THE Authentication_System SHALL provide an option to resend verification email
4. WHERE email verification is pending, THE Authentication_System SHALL show appropriate UI state with verification instructions
5. IF a user tries to sign in before email verification, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL explain the verification requirement instead of showing generic "Authentication Failed"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily verify my email address after registration, so that I can access my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration, THE Authentication_System SHALL send a verification email automatically
2. WHEN a user requests resend verification, THE Authentication_System SHALL send a new verification email within 30 seconds
3. WHEN a user clicks the verification link, THE Authentication_System SHALL confirm the email and allow sign in
4. WHILE waiting for verification, THE Authentication_System SHALL provide clear instructions and resend option
5. WHERE verification fails, THE Authentication_System SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Supabase authentication settings properly, so that the verification flow works seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL check user confirmation status before allowing sign in
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL handle both confirmed and unconfirmed user states appropriately
3. WHEN Supabase returns authentication errors, THE Authentication_System SHALL parse and display user-friendly messages
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide option to disable email verification for development/testing
5. WHERE email verification is disabled, THE Authentication_System SHALL allow immediate sign in after registration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth authentication experience that handles verification states gracefully, so that I'm not confused by error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails due to unverified email, THE Authentication_System SHALL show verification-specific UI
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL persist user email across verification flow for easy resend
3. WHEN verification is complete, THE Authentication_System SHALL automatically proceed to main app
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide clear visual feedback for all authentication states
5. WHERE network issues occur, THE Authentication_System SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms
