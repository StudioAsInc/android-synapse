# Supabase Migration Completion Requirements

## Introduction

Complete the remaining 40% of the Firebase to Supabase migration for the Synapse Android application. The migration infrastructure is in place but many files still have compilation errors due to missing Firebase compatibility imports and service implementation issues.

## Glossary

- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative providing database, authentication, and realtime features
- **Firebase Compatibility Layer**: Wrapper classes that provide Firebase-like interfaces while using Supabase backend
- **Compilation Errors**: Build failures preventing the application from compiling successfully
- **Migration Progress**: Current state shows ~60% completion with infrastructure in place

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all compilation errors resolved so that the application builds successfully with Supabase

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs, THE Build_System SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN Firebase compatibility imports are missing, THE Migration_System SHALL add the required imports
3. WHEN Supabase services have compilation errors, THE Migration_System SHALL fix the service implementations
4. WHEN model conflicts exist, THE Migration_System SHALL resolve import and type mismatches
5. WHERE files reference Firebase classes, THE Migration_System SHALL ensure compatibility layer imports are present

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Supabase services to work correctly so that the application functions with the new backend

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is required, THE SupabaseAuthenticationService SHALL provide working auth methods
2. WHEN database operations are needed, THE SupabaseDatabaseService SHALL execute CRUD operations successfully
3. WHEN realtime features are used, THE SupabaseRealtimeService SHALL handle subscriptions correctly
4. WHILE the application runs, THE Supabase_Services SHALL maintain compatibility with existing code
5. IF service methods are called, THEN THE Supabase_Services SHALL return expected data types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all activity files migrated to use Supabase so that the application works end-to-end

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MainActivity loads, THE MainActivity SHALL use Supabase authentication services
2. WHEN ChatActivity is opened, THE ChatActivity SHALL use Supabase realtime messaging
3. WHEN CreatePostActivity is used, THE CreatePostActivity SHALL save posts to Supabase database
4. WHEN ConversationSettingsActivity loads, THE ConversationSettingsActivity SHALL fetch data from Supabase
5. WHERE Java activities exist, THE Migration_System SHALL update them to use compatibility layer

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all adapter classes to work with Supabase data so that UI components display correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PostsAdapter displays posts, THE PostsAdapter SHALL handle Supabase data structures
2. WHEN ChatMessagesListRecyclerAdapter shows messages, THE ChatMessagesListRecyclerAdapter SHALL work with Supabase realtime
3. WHEN CommentsAdapter displays comments, THE CommentsAdapter SHALL handle nullable fields correctly
4. WHILE adapters process data, THE Adapter_Classes SHALL handle type conversions properly
5. IF data types mismatch, THEN THE Migration_System SHALL fix type casting issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to run without Firebase dependencies so that the migration is complete

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE Application SHALL initialize only Supabase services
2. WHEN authentication flows execute, THE Authentication_System SHALL use only Supabase Auth
3. WHEN data operations occur, THE Database_System SHALL use only Supabase PostgREST
4. WHEN realtime features activate, THE Realtime_System SHALL use only Supabase Realtime
5. WHERE Firebase references remain, THE Migration_System SHALL replace them with Supabase equivalents
