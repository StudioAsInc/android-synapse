# Clean Supabase Migration Requirements

## Introduction

Complete migration from Firebase to Supabase by removing all Firebase dependencies and compatibility layers, implementing native Supabase patterns throughout the application. This will result in a clean, modern codebase using Supabase's native Kotlin client.

## Glossary

- **Native Supabase Implementation**: Direct use of Supabase Kotlin client without Firebase compatibility wrappers
- **Coroutine-Based Architecture**: Modern async/await patterns using Kotlin coroutines instead of Firebase callbacks
- **PostgREST Queries**: Direct SQL-like queries using Supabase's PostgREST API
- **Realtime Subscriptions**: Native Supabase realtime channels instead of Firebase listeners
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with proper repository pattern and dependency injection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Firebase dependencies completely removed so that the application uses only Supabase

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs, THE Build_System SHALL contain no Firebase dependencies
2. WHEN code is analyzed, THE Codebase SHALL contain no Firebase imports or references
3. WHEN the compatibility layer is removed, THE Application SHALL use native Supabase patterns
4. WHILE maintaining functionality, THE Migration_System SHALL replace all Firebase callbacks with coroutines
5. WHERE Firebase listeners exist, THE Migration_System SHALL implement Supabase realtime subscriptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want native Supabase authentication so that user management uses modern patterns

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users sign in, THE Authentication_System SHALL use Supabase Auth directly
2. WHEN user sessions are managed, THE Session_Manager SHALL use Supabase session handling
3. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Auth_Observer SHALL use Supabase auth state flows
4. WHILE handling auth errors, THE Error_Handler SHALL process Supabase-specific exceptions
5. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Auth_System SHALL provide clear Supabase error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want native Supabase database operations so that data access is efficient and type-safe

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is queried, THE Database_Layer SHALL use PostgREST queries directly
2. WHEN data is inserted, THE Database_Layer SHALL use Supabase insert operations with proper serialization
3. WHEN data is updated, THE Database_Layer SHALL use Supabase update operations with conflict resolution
4. WHILE handling relationships, THE Database_Layer SHALL use PostgREST joins and foreign keys
5. WHERE complex queries are needed, THE Database_Layer SHALL use Supabase RPC functions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want native Supabase realtime features so that live updates work efficiently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are sent, THE Realtime_System SHALL broadcast changes through Supabase channels
2. WHEN users come online, THE Presence_System SHALL use Supabase presence tracking
3. WHEN data changes occur, THE Subscription_Manager SHALL notify UI components through flows
4. WHILE managing subscriptions, THE Realtime_Manager SHALL handle connection lifecycle properly
5. IF realtime connection fails, THEN THE System SHALL implement proper reconnection logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper repository pattern implementation so that data access is clean and testable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is accessed, THE Repository_Layer SHALL abstract Supabase implementation details
2. WHEN business logic executes, THE Use_Cases SHALL depend on repository interfaces not implementations
3. WHEN UI components need data, THE ViewModels SHALL use repositories through dependency injection
4. WHILE handling errors, THE Repository_Layer SHALL convert Supabase exceptions to domain errors
5. WHERE caching is needed, THE Repository_Layer SHALL implement proper caching strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern Kotlin patterns so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async operations execute, THE Application SHALL use coroutines and flows exclusively
2. WHEN data is serialized, THE Serialization_Layer SHALL use Kotlinx Serialization with proper annotations
3. WHEN dependency injection is needed, THE DI_System SHALL use a modern DI framework like Hilt
4. WHILE handling state, THE State_Management SHALL use sealed classes and data classes
5. WHERE null safety is required, THE Type_System SHALL use proper nullable types and safe calls
