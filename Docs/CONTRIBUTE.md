## Commit Message Guidelines
We use a conventional commit message format to keep our commit history clean and easy to read. Please follow these guidelines for your commit messages.

### Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.
```
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

### Type
Must be one of the following:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
- Use the imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end

### Body
- Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense.
- Include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
- The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

### Example
```
feat: add user profile page

This commit introduces a new user profile page that displays user information,
including username, profile picture, and recent activity.

Closes #123
