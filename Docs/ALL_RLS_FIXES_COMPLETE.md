# ðŸŽ‰ All RLS Security Issues Fixed!

## Summary

All backend security (RLS) issues have been resolved. Your Synapse app is now fully functional!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Chat Feature (FIXED)
**Problem**: Couldn't create chats or send messages  
**Cause**: RLS policies using Supabase Auth UUID instead of custom uid  
**Solution**: Created `get_current_user_uid()` helper function and updated all chat policies  
**Status**: âœ… WORKING

### 2. âœ… Home Feed "Unknown User" (FIXED)
**Problem**: Posts showing "Unknown User" instead of actual usernames  
**Cause**: Overly restrictive users table RLS policy  
**Solution**: Updated users policy to allow viewing public profiles  
**Status**: âœ… WORKING

## What's Working Now

### Chat Features
- âœ… Create new chats from Search
- âœ… Send text messages
- âœ… View message history
- âœ… Chat list in Inbox
- âœ… User info in chats

### Home Feed Features
- âœ… View posts with correct usernames
- âœ… See user avatars
- âœ… View comments with author names
- âœ… See who liked posts
- âœ… Follow/unfollow users

### Profile Features

## Technical Details

### Helper Function Created
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_user_uid()
RETURNS TEXT
LANGUAGE SQL SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public, pg_temp
AS $$
  SELECT uid FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1;
$$;
```

**Purpose**: Converts Supabase Auth UUID to your custom user ID

### Tables Updated

| Table | Policies Updated | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
