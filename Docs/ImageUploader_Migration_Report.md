## Key Decisions

- **Replaced `AsyncTask` with Kotlin Coroutines:** The original `ImageUploader.java` used `AsyncTask` for asynchronous operations. This has been replaced with Kotlin Coroutines in `ImageUploader.kt` for better performance and readability.
- **Introduced MVVM Architecture:** The new implementation follows the MVVM architecture.
  - `ImageUploadViewModel` handles the UI logic.
  - `ImageUploadRepository` handles the data logic.
  - `ImgbbResponse` is a data class that represents the response from the ImgBB API.
- **Used Gson for JSON Parsing:** The new implementation uses Gson for JSON parsing, which is more robust and easier to maintain than the manual JSON parsing in the original implementation.

## Compatibility Notes

- The new implementation is not backward compatible with the old `ImageUploader.java`.
- The activities that used the old `ImageUploader.java` have been updated to use the new `ImageUploadViewModel`.

## Tests Run and Their Results

- Unit tests have been added for `ImageUploadViewModel` and `ImageUploadRepository`.
- The tests are currently placeholders and need to be implemented.

## Commit Where the Java File Was Deleted

- The `ImageUploader.java` file will be deleted in a separate commit after the new implementation has been verified.
