# Chat RLS Security Fix

## Problem Identified

The chat feature wasn't working due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies that were incompatible with your custom user ID system.

### Root Cause

Your Synapse app uses a **dual user ID system**:
- `users.id` (UUID) - Supabase Auth user ID
- `users.uid` (text) - Your custom user identifier

The original RLS policies used `auth.uid()` which returns the Supabase Auth UUID (`users.id`), but your app's chat system uses the custom `uid` field for all user references.

**Result**: Users couldn't access chats or send messages because the RLS policies were checking the wrong user ID.

## Solution Applied

Created a migration that:

1. **Added Helper Function**: `get_current_user_uid()`
   - Converts Supabase Auth UUID to your custom uid
   - Used in all RLS policies for consistent user identification

2. **Updated All Chat RLS Policies**:
   - Chats table: View, create, and update policies
   - Messages table: View, send, update, and delete policies
   - Chat_participants table: View, join, and admin management policies

## New RLS Policies

### Chats Table
- ✅ **Users can view their chats**: Users see chats they participate in
- ✅ **Users can create chats**: Users can create new chats
- ✅ **Chat creators can update chats**: Creators and admins can modify chat settings

### Messages Table
- ✅ **Users can view their chat messages**: Users see messages in their chats
- ✅ **Users can send messages**: Users can send messages to chats they're in
- ✅ **Users can update own messages**: Users can edit their own messages
- ✅ **Users can delete own messages**: Users can delete their own messages

### Chat_Participants Table
- ✅ **Users can view chat participants**: Users see who's in their chats
- ✅ **Users can join chats**: Users can add themselves to chats
- ✅ **Admins can manage participants**: Chat admins can add/remove participants

## How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```sql
-- Old policy checked Supabase Auth UUID
auth.uid() = 'c2b7ad1f-609c-4887-8c22-16f0174b97f6'  -- Supabase ID
-- But app used custom uid
sender_id = 'd4470a05-209e-4987-a2c9-2eb5e13e8315'  -- Custom uid
-- ❌ Mismatch! Access denied
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- New policy uses helper function
get_current_user_uid() = 'd4470a05-209e-4987-a2c9-2eb5e13e8315'  -- Custom uid
-- App uses custom uid
sender_id = 'd4470a05-209e-4987-a2c9-2eb5e13e8315'  -- Custom uid
-- ✅ Match! Access granted
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Create a New Chat
```kotlin
// In SearchActivity, tap a user
// ChatActivity opens with uid parameter
val intent = Intent(context, ChatActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("uid", "other-user-uid")
startActivity(intent)
```

**Expected**: Chat creates successfully, no RLS errors

### 2. Send a Message
```kotlin
// In ChatActivity, type and send a message
chatService.sendMessage(
    chatId = "dm_user1_user2",
    senderId = currentUserUid,  // Your custom uid
    content = "Hello!",
    messageType = "text"
)
```

**Expected**: Message saves to database and appears in chat

### 3. View Chat List
```kotlin
// In InboxChatsFragment
chatService.getUserChats(currentUserUid)
```

**Expected**: All user's chats load and display

## Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:

```sql
-- Check if helper function exists
SELECT proname, prosrc 
FROM pg_proc 
WHERE proname = 'get_current_user_uid';

-- Check current policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('chats', 'messages', 'chat_participants')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- Test the helper function (when logged in)
SELECT get_current_user_uid();
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Secure
- Helper function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to safely query users table
- Policies still enforce proper access control
- Users can only access their own chats and messages
- Admin privileges properly checked

### 🔒 Best Practices Applied
- Principle of least privilege
- No data leakage between users
- Proper authentication checks
- Audit trail maintained (created_by, sender_id)

## Performance Impact

The helper function adds a small overhead:
- One additional query per RLS check
- Query is simple and indexed (users.id is primary key)
- Negligible impact for typical chat usage

**Optimization**: The function result could be cached per request in future if needed.

## Migration Details

**Migration Name**: `fix_chat_rls_policies_for_custom_uid`

**Applied**: Successfully applied to production database

**Rollback**: If needed, can revert by:
1. Dropping new policies
2. Dropping helper function
3. Recreating original policies (not recommended)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "permission denied for table chats"
**Cause**: RLS policy not matching user
**Solution**: Verify user is logged in and `get_current_user_uid()` returns correct uid

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Cause**: Trying to insert with wrong user_id
**Solution**: Ensure `sender_id` or `created_by` matches current user's custom uid

### Issue: Messages not appearing
**Cause**: User not in chat_participants table
**Solution**: Ensure `addChatParticipant()` is called when creating chat

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test chat creation from Search
2. ✅ Test message sending
3. ✅ Test chat list loading
4. ✅ Verify RLS is working (no unauthorized access)
5. 🔄 Add real-time subscriptions (optional)
6. 🔄 Add message read receipts (optional)

## Summary

The chat feature should now work correctly! The RLS policies have been updated to work with your custom user ID system. Users can:
- ✅ Create new chats
- ✅ Send and receive messages
- ✅ View their chat list
- ✅ Access message history

All while maintaining proper security and access control.
