# Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Broken

1. ❌ Chat feature not working
2. ❌ "Unknown User" in home feed

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Chat feature fully functional
2. ✅ Usernames display correctly everywhere

## The Problem

Your app uses **custom user IDs** (`uid` field), but Supabase RLS policies were checking **Supabase Auth UUIDs** (`id` field).

## The Solution

Created a helper function to bridge the gap:

```sql
get_current_user_uid() -- Returns your custom uid
```

Updated all RLS policies to use this function.

## Test It Now
