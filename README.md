## 🚀 Introduction  
**Synapse** is an open-source social media platform built with Kotlin for Android, using Supabase as the backend. Designed with privacy, real-time communication, and a lightweight user experience at its core, Synapse provides a secure, ad-free environment where users can connect and express themselves freely.

**Architecture**: MVVM with Repository pattern, leveraging Kotlin coroutines for async operations and StateFlow for reactive UI updates.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** (latest stable version recommended)
- **JDK 17** or higher
- **Git**
- **Supabase Account** (for backend configuration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StudioAsInc/android-synapse.git
   cd android-synapse
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase**
   
   Synapse requires Supabase credentials for backend connectivity. You can configure these in two ways:

   **Option 1: gradle.properties (Recommended for local development)**
   
   Create or edit `gradle.properties` in the project root:
   
   ```properties
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SYNAPSE_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=your_s3_endpoint
   SUPABASE_SYNAPSE_S3_ENDPOINT_REGION=your_s3_region
   SUPABASE_SYNAPSE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_s3_access_key_id
   SUPABASE_SYNAPSE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_s3_access_key
   ```

   **Option 2: Environment Variables (Recommended for CI/CD)**
   
   Set the same variables as environment variables in your system.

   > **Security Note**: Never commit credentials to version control. Both `gradle.properties` and `local.properties` are in `.gitignore`.

   **Getting Supabase Credentials**:
   1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   2. Create a new project
   3. Go to Project Settings → API
   4. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key
   5. For S3 storage, configure in Project Settings → Storage

3. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned directory

4. **Sync and Build**
   - Let Gradle sync the project
   - Build the project: `Build > Make Project`
   - Run on emulator or device

To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

- **Kotlin Style Guide**: Follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Prefer `val` over `var` when possible
  - Use data classes for models
  - Leverage Kotlin extensions and Android KTX

- **Coroutines for Async Operations**: Use Kotlin coroutines instead of callbacks

- **MVVM Architecture Pattern**: Follow the established architecture
  - ViewModels manage UI state using StateFlow/LiveData
  - Repositories abstract data layer (Supabase, local storage)
  - Separate UI logic from business logic
  - Use lifecycle-aware components

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Synapse completely free to use?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes, Synapse is free and operates on a non-profit model. We do not have ads or premium features that require payment.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What makes Synapse different from other social platforms?</strong></summary>
<br>
Synapse prioritizes user privacy and experience. We offer an ad-free environment, end-to-end encrypted chats, generous free storage (35GB+), and our platform is fully open-source.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What platforms is Synapse currently available on?</strong></summary>
<br>
Synapse is available for Android and has a web version. You can find links to both on our official <a href="https://dl-synapse.pages.dev">website</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is my privacy protected on Synapse?</strong></summary>
<br>
We use end-to-end encryption for all private chats, meaning only you and the recipient can read the messages. We are committed to minimizing data collection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the project stable?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes! The project has successfully completed two major modernization efforts: the Firebase to Supabase backend migration and the Java to Kotlin migration. Core features like authentication, chat, posts, and profiles are stable and production-ready. Real-time features and group chats are currently in development. See the <a href="#project-status">Project Status</a> section for detailed feature stability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I contribute to the project?</strong></summary>
<br>
Absolutely! We welcome contributions from everyone. Please check out the <a href="#-contributing">Contributing</a> section to get started.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What technology does Synapse use?</strong></summary>
<br>
The Android app is built with Kotlin 2.2.0 using MVVM architecture, Kotlin Coroutines, ViewBinding, and Material Design 3 (1.14.0-alpha06). Key libraries include Supabase BOM 2.6.0, Glide 5.0.0-rc01, Markwon 4.6.2, and Media3 1.3.1. The backend is powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL via Postgrest, GoTrue Auth, Storage, and Realtime). Build targets: Min SDK 26, Target SDK 32, Compile SDK 36, JDK 17.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I host my own instance of Synapse?</strong></summary>
<br>
While self-hosting is a goal for the future, it is not officially supported at this time. The project's open-source nature, however, allows for community experimentation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What was the Java to Kotlin migration?</strong></summary>
<br>
In late 2024, Synapse underwent a comprehensive migration from Java to Kotlin, converting 27 core files. This modernization brought improved null safety, coroutines for async operations, Kotlin idioms (data classes, sealed classes, extensions), and better code maintainability. The migration is complete and documented in <a href="Docs/JAVA_TO_KOTLIN_MIGRATION.md">JAVA_TO_KOTLIN_MIGRATION.md</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a Supabase account to contribute?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes, to build and test the app locally, you'll need a free Supabase account to configure the backend. However, you can contribute to documentation, UI improvements, or code refactoring without running the app. For backend work, Supabase's free tier provides everything needed for development. See the <a href="#installation">Getting Started</a> section for setup instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I test the app locally?</strong></summary>
<br>
After setting up your Supabase credentials in <code>gradle.properties</code>, open the project in Android Studio, sync Gradle, and run the app on an emulator or physical device. For automated testing, run <code>./gradlew test</code> for unit tests or <code>./gradlew connectedAndroidTest</code> for instrumented tests. See <a href="Docs/CHAT_TESTING_GUIDE.md">CHAT_TESTING_GUIDE.md</a> for feature-specific testing guidance.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the Supabase backend requirements?</strong></summary>
<br>
Synapse requires a Supabase project with the following services enabled: GoTrue (authentication), Postgrest (database), Storage (media files), and Realtime (live updates). You'll need to configure your Supabase URL, anon key, and S3 storage credentials in <code>gradle.properties</code> or environment variables. The free tier provides 500MB database storage, 1GB file storage, and 2GB bandwidth—sufficient for development and testing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Who is behind Synapse?</strong></summary>
<br>
Synapse is a project developed and maintained by StudioAs Inc. and a dedicated community of open-source contributors.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where can I report a bug or suggest a feature?</strong></summary>
<br>
You can report bugs or request new features by creating an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/StudioAsInc/android-synapse/issues">GitHub repository</a>.
